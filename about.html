    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Brendan Lunga. I am a graduate student journalist at Nortwestern Medill. I graduated with a bachelor of arts 
        from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, double majoring in Media and Journalism and History.
    </p>
    <p>Professionally, I have worked as a sports writer at multiple publications, including The Daily Tar Heel, The Daily Northwestern
        and Keeping It Heel. I have covered the College World Series, the Olympics and the Super Bowl throughout my career. 
        Sports journalism is my passion, and I plan to continue pursuing it after graduation.
