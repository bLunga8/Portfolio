    <p>The NBA could be in trouble.</p>
    <p>TV viewership data has plummeted during the 2024-2025 season, marking the continuation of a decade-long fall for the league. 
        According to <a href="https://x.com/TheDunkCentral/status/1851630593651458279?lang=en" target="_blank">NBACentral</a>, 
        many of this year's games have averaged well below their totals from last season. ESPN's opening doubleheader was down 42%. 
        Nationally televised games in the Thursday and Friday windows averaged just 1.45 million and 830,000 viewers, respectively.</p>
    <p>With this trend matching that of <a href="https://www.sportsmediawatch.com/nba-finals-ratings-viewership-history/" target="_blank">NBA Finals viewership</a> over the last 30 years, the league finds itself in a concerning spot.</p>

    <p>NBA commissioner Adam Silver commented on the latest viewership data in a recent interview on The Dan Patrick Show by 
        saying “the ratings are fine.”</p>
    <p>“There's a lot of people out there who may not be fans of the NBA and become consumed with that story,” 
        Silver said on the podcast. “And again, (the) NBA seems to take a disproportionate amount of that discussion.”</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, the drop in ratings has caused a debate among the NBA community. Some echo Silver's sentiments. 
        But others believe it is a troubling trend that the NBA can't ignore.</p>
    <p>Various reasons have been provided for why fans may be losing interest in the league. It could be because the three-point line
        plays too big a role in today's game. Load management has been another hotly contested topic throughout the last few years.</p>

    <p>But not all is bad for Silver and the NBA.</p>
    <p>While ratings may be down domestically, viewership around the world has spiked. The ever-increasing population of 
        international players in the league has led to increased ratings outside of the United States.</p>
    <p>These gains can be seen in other North American countries as well as in Europe and Asia. NBA viewership data is 
        difficult to measure in many regions, but <a href="https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/nba-chinas-nba-viewership-approaching-pre-ban-levels-source-2022-12-08/" target="_blank">ratings numbers from select nations</a> like Portugal and China show how the 
        NBA's audience is expanding internationally.</p>

    <p>On top of that, NBA fans are excited for the future of the league. With young players like Victor Wembenyama and 
        Anthony Edwards ready to take over, there's reason to be optimistic for what's ahead. </p>
    <p>According to a recent survey by <a href="https://playfly.com/app/uploads/2024/03/FINAL_Playfly-Fan-Score_NBA2024_UPDATED.pdf" target="_blank">Playfly Sports and Vision Insights</a>, every age group of fans, from 13-65+, 
        has a more positive than negative outlook on the NBA. These numbers are particularly staggering for the key 
        demographic of 35-44 year olds.</p>

    <p>Whether the decline in viewership is due to poor play on the court or a larger cord-cutting trend, 
        it will remain a difficult issue for the league as long as the national conversation continues to focus on the low numbers.</p>
    <p>How Silver responds to this conversation will play a major role in how the NBA looks over the next decade. 
        Will the league move the three-point line back? Will more financial incentives be introduced to motivate players to play 
        harder? Or will Silver keep the product the same on the court and instead look to alternative platforms to stream NBA games?</p>
    <p>These are all questions that will be answered over the next few years as the NBA tries to reshape the narrative that now 
        surrounds the league.</p>
